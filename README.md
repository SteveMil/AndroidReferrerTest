AndroidReferrerTest
===================

Referrer Test for Google Play is an Android test application that shows how you
can pass a 'referrer' string from a website/email/ad/whatever to the Google Play
store on Android, have the user install your application, and then have the Play
store pass the string into your Android application.

More information can be found at the following website...

You can find this project in the Google Play store here...
    https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=net.stevemiller.android.referrertest

To test how Referrer Test works, you should navigate to the market from a URL
that has a 'referrer' parameter as part of the URL. The website above will allow
you to build a properly formatted URL that will launch the Play store, where you
can then install the application to test how the referrer string is delivered to
the application.
