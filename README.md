June 2015 Update
================

After 2-1/2 years of being in the Play Store, Google has banned my application
without warning because my icon contained a portion of the Google Play icon
within it.  I offered to change the icon and submit a new version, but I was
told my app is banned for life.  I'm not sure those terms even existed 2-1/2
years ago, but nonetheless, the terms do exist now and it appears my icon
probably does violates the terms.  My bad.  I'm told I can create a new account
and submit a brand new app, but I think I'm done with Google Play for now.


AndroidReferrerTest
===================

Referrer Test for Google Play is an Android test application that shows how you
can pass a 'referrer' string from a website/email/ad/whatever to the Google Play
store on Android, have the user install your application, and then have the Play
store pass the string into your Android application.

More information can be found at the following website...
    http://SteveMiller.net/ReferrerTest/

You can find this project in the Google Play store here...
    https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=net.stevemiller.android.referrertest

To test how Referrer Test works, you should navigate to the market from a URL
that has a 'referrer' parameter as part of the URL. The website above will allow
you to build a properly formatted URL that will launch the Play store, where you
can then install the application to test how the referrer string is delivered to
the application.
